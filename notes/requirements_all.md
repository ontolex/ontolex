Last update: 15/05/2025

## Introduction
This is a unified relation of requirements for OntoLex core model v2, grouped in three different topics, as thery were detected/reported by the community: 
* Lexicography
* Terminology
* DMLex

### Lexicography requirements 
- RL1. Need to associate a lexical sense to a particular form of a lexical entry, e.g., game, games [^2] (not limited to lexicographic resources but is common in them) 
- RL2. Need to have entry elements with different parts of speech (frequent in dictionaries, creation of different entries in this case creates disparity with original source in case of retrodigitization)
- RL3. Need to include usage examples (common in dictionaries)
