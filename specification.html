    This document describes the lexicon model for ontologies (<i>lemon</i>) as a main outcome of the work of the Ontology Lexicon (Ontolex) community group. </p>
<p>Ontologies are an important component of the Semantic Web but current ontology languages such as OWL and RDF(S) lack support for enriching ontologies with linguistic information, in particular with information concerning how ontology entities, i.e. properties, classes, individuals, etc. can be realized in natural language. The model described in this document aims to close this gap by providing a vocabulary that allows ontologies to be enriched with information about how the vocabulary elements described in them are realized linguistically, in particular in natural languages.</p>
<p>OWL and RDF(S) rely on the RDFS lable property to capture the relation between a vocabulary element and its (preferred) lexicalization in a given language. This lexicalization provides a lexical anchor that makes the class, property, individual etc. understandable to a human user. The use of a simple label for linguistic grounding as available in OWL and RDF(S) is far from being able to capture the necessary linguistic and lexical information that Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications working with a particular ontology need.</p>
<p>The aim of <i>lemon</i> is to provide rich linguistic grounding for ontologies. Rich linguistic grounding includes the representation of morphological and syntactic properties of lexical entries as well as the syntax-semantics interface, i.e. the meaning of these lexical entries with respect to an ontology or vocabulary.

<section><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document describes the specification of the <em>lexicon model for ontologies</em> (<i>lemon</i>) as resulting from the work of the W3C Ontology Lexicon Community Group.</p>
<p>The aim of the <em>lexicon model for ontologies</em> (<i>lemon</i>) is to provide rich linguistic grounding for ontologies. Rich linguistic grounding includes the representation of morphological and syntactic properties of lexical entries as well as the syntax-semantics interface, i.e. the meaning of these lexical entries with respect to an ontology or vocabulary.</p>
<p>This document is structured into nine sections, where the first five correspond to the main modules of <i>lemon</i>. Depending on their needs and requirements, applications will use one or more of the modules mentioned below, with the use of the OntoLex module being the minimal choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ontology-lexicon interface (ontolex)</li>
<li>Syntax and Semantics (synsem)</li>
<li>Decomposition (decomp)</li>
<li>Variation and Translation (vartrans)</li>
<li>Linguistic Metadata (lime)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last three sections do not describe the formal modelling but clarify</p>
<ul>
<li>how one can add linguistic levels of description by means of external ontologies (section Linguistic Description)</li>
<li>how one can use <i>lemon</i> to describe lexical nets and other linguistic resources (section Lexical Nets)</li>
<li>the relation between <i>lemon</i> and the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), the Lexical Markup Model (LMF), and the Open Annotation Model (section Relation to Other Models)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ontologies are an important component of the Semantic Web but current standards such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL</a> only support the addition of a simple label to entities in the ontology. It is not currently possible to add inflected forms, different genders, usage notes or create a full lexical resource such as Princeton WordNet. The model described in this document aims to close this gap by providing a vocabulary that allows ontologies to be enriched with information about how the vocabulary elements described in them are realized linguistically, in particular in natural languages, in order to render ontologies suitable for supporting meaningful interaction with and manipulation of them by human users and allowing NLP tools to be able work with ontologies.</p>
<p>OWL and RDF(S) rely on a property <code class="cm">rdfs:label</code> to capture the relation between a vocabulary element and its (preferred) lexicalization in a given language. This lexicalization provides a lexical anchor that makes the concept, property, individual etc. understandable to a human user. The use of a simple label for linguistic grounding as available in OWL and RDF(S) is far from being able to capture the necessary linguistic and lexical information that Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications working with a particular ontology need. Such NLP applications are for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language generation systems that produce coherent discourses by verbalizing a set of triples</li>
<li>Question Answering systems that interpret user questions with respect to one or more ontologies</li>
<li>Text interpretation systems that extract triples with respect to one or more ontologies</li>
<li>Query interpretation and semantic search in information retrieval systems</li>
<li>Natural language based interfaces to ontologies, Semantic Web and Linked Data.</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-model">Purpose of the model</h2>
<p>The purpose of the model is to support linguistic grounding of a given ontology by adding information about how the elements in the vocabulary of the ontology (individuals, classes, properties) are lexicalized in a given natural language.</p>
<p>The model follows the principle of <em>semantics by reference</em> [<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-012-9182-3/fulltext.html">1</a>] in the sense that the semantics of a <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entry</a> is expressed by reference to an individual, class or property defined in the ontology. In some cases, the lexicon itself can add named concepts which are not made explicit in the ontology.</p>
<p>The model described here is open in the sense that it provides a core vocabulary to add information about the linguistic realization of ontology and vocabulary elements. This vocabulary can and should be extended as required by a particular application. In particular, the model abstracts from specific linguistic theory or category systems used to describe the linguistic properties of lexical entries and their syntactic behavior, encouraging reuse of existing data category systems or linguistic ontologies. The model is thus agnostic with respect to the linguistic theory and category systems. We make explicit in this document at which points we refer to an external repository of data categories or introduce novel sub-properties of properties defined in <i>lemon</i>.</p>
<p>The model as presented here is inspired by many other models, in particular the <a href="http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org">Lexical Markup Framework</a> (LMF), the <a href="http://www.lexinfo.net/">LexInfo</a> model, the <a href="http://mayor2.dia.fi.upm.es/oeg-upm/index.php/en/technologies/63-lir">LIR</a> model, the <a href="http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Ontology:LMM">Linguistic Meta Model</a> (LMM), the <a href="http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/semiotics.owl">semiotics.owl</a> ontology design pattern, and the <a href="http://www.sensocomune.it">Senso Comune</a> core model.</p>
<p>It is important to also mention what is not the purpose of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not the goal of the model to replace any existing W3C Standard or Recommendation. In particular, this model is not intended to represent informal schemas such as taxonomies, thesauri and other classification schemes. This is covered by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> model.</li>
<li>It is not a vocabulary for annotation of texts. If you need to add annotations to textual data, then please consider using the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation</a>, <a href="http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core/nif-core.html">NLP Interchange Format (NIF)</a> or the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/http://www.essepuntato.it/2008/12/earmark">Extremely Annotational RDF Markup (Earmark)</a>.</li>
<li>It is not a formal model of semantics but a model of lexicography. The model is not supposed to be used to define an ontology and instead assumes that there is a given ontology in some ontology language that is to be linked to a lexicon that expresses how the classes, properties and individuals defined in the ontology are lexicalized.</li>
<li>It does not contain a complete collection of linguistic categories. There are many existing efforts to provide a vocabulary to describe the properties of linguistic objects, such as <a href="http://www.isocat.org">ISOcat</a>, <a href="https://openskos.meertens.knaw.nl/ccr/browser/">the CLARIN concept registry</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/olia/">OLiA</a>, <a href="http://linguistics-ontology.org/">GOLD</a>, <a href="http://www.lexinfo.net">LexInfo</a>. The model builds on those and does not introduce any vocabulary of linguistic description.</li>
<li>The lexicon model for ontologies is a model for describing lexical resources in connection to ontologies, it is not a generic vocabulary supporting the publication of any sort of linguistic data including typological data, corpora, word lists etc. See the activities of the <a href="http://linguistics.okfn.org/">Open Linguistics Working Group</a> for more information here.</li>
</ul></section>
<section>
<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>
<p>The model is available with the following sub-namespaces for the various modules of the overall model:</p>
<ul>

</ul></section>
<section>
<h2 id="conventions-in-this-document">Conventions in this document</h2>
<p>Throughout this document, we will use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle RDF Syntax</a> to provide examples showing the use of the model. Axioms will be paraphrased in natural language. We will assume the following namespaces throughout all the examples in this document:</p>
<pre><code class="cm">@prefix ontolex: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#&gt; .
@prefix synsem: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/synsem#&gt; .
@prefix decomp: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/decomp#&gt; .
@prefix vartrans: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/vartrans#&gt; .
@prefix lime: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lime#&gt; .</code></pre>
<p>As we frequently also refer to other models, we will also assume the following namespaces in all examples:</p>
<pre><code class="cm">@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;.
@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;.
@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;.
@prefix skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos#&gt;.
@prefix dbr: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/&gt;.
@prefix dbo: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/&gt;.
@prefix void: &lt;http://rdfs.org/ns/void#&gt;.
@prefix lexinfo: &lt;http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo#&gt;.
@prefix semiotics: &lt;http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/semiotics.owl#&gt;.
@prefix oils: &lt;http://lemon-model.net/oils#&gt;.
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;.
@prefix provo: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#&gt;.</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, we require that instances of the model adhere to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF 1.1 specification</a> and follow the appropriate guidelines. In particular, we require that language tags adhere to <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">Best Common Practice 47</a>, where tags are made up of a language code (based on <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/language_codes.htm">ISO 639 codes part 1, 2, 3 or 5</a>), optionally followed by a hyphen and a <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso-3166-1_decoding_table.html">ISO 3166-1</a> country code. Language tags may also contain further <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">subtags</a> expressing e.g. the region, script or further variants.</p>
<p>In all examples in this document, the above namespaces are introduced using an appropriate <code class="cm">@prefix</code> statement. Prefixes are omitted from class and object property definitions if the referenced ontology element is defined in the same module. For cross-module and external references, the prefix is made explicit.</p>
<p>In many examples we will use the <a href="http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo#">LexInfo</a> ontology to describe grammatical categories, although this is not required for using this model. The LexInfo model and guidelines for constructing and extending linguistic category schemes are provided in the section on <a href="#linguistic-description">linguistic description</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lexical-entries">Lexical Entries</h2>
<p>The main class of the core of the lexicon ontology model is the class <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">Lexical Entry</a>. A lexical entry is defined as follows:</p>
<div id="LexicalEntry" class='entity'>
<h3>Lexical Entry (Class)</h3>

</div>
<div class='comment'>
<p>A <strong>lexical entry</strong> represents a unit of analysis of the lexicon that consists of a set of forms that are grammatically related and a set of base meanings that are associated with all of these forms. Thus, a lexical entry is a word, multiword expression or affix with a single part-of-speech, morphological pattern, etymology and set of senses.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>SubClassOf:</strong> lexicalForm min 1 Form, canonicalForm max 1 Form, semiotics:Expression</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A Lexical Entry thus needs to be associated with at least one <a href="#Form" title="wikilink">form</a>, and has at most one <a href="#canonicalForm" title="wikilink">canonical form</a> (see below).</p>
<p>Lexical entries are further specialized into <a href="#Word" title="wikilink">words</a>, <a href="#Affix" title="wikilink">affixes</a> (e.g., suffix, prefix, infix or circumfix) and <a href="#MultiwordExpression" title="wikilink">multiword expressions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>
<p>A <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entry</a> can be realized in different ways from a grammatical point of view. These different grammatical realizations are represented as different <a href="#Form" title="wikilink">forms</a> of the lexical entry. A <a href="#Form" title="wikilink">form</a> is defined as follows:</p>
<div id="Form" class='entity'>
<h3>Form (Class)</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>Different forms are used to express different morphological forms of the entry. They should not be used to represent ortographical variants, which should be represented as different representations of the same form. For example, for the lexical entry <em>color</em>, we would have two different representations of the same form, one for the British English written representation <em>colour</em> and one for the American English written representation <em>color</em>. Both representations have the same pronunciation and the same meaning, so they are two different lexicographic variants of the same lexical entry:</p>

<p>A lexical entry has a canonical form, which is the form that primarily identifies this entry and may be used as an index term in the lexicon. The canonical form for single words is typically the lemma of that word and is determined by lexicographic conventions for that language. In the case of verbs, the lemma is typically the infinitive form or, alternatively, the present tense of the verb (note that if an external particle is used to indicate the infinitive as in English &quot;to play&quot;, this particle should be omitted). For nouns it is the noun singular form, while for adjectives it is the positive (i.e., non-negative, non-graded) form. For multiword entries it is assumed that the same principles of lemmatization are applied to the head word.</p>
<p>The property <a href="#canonicalForm" title="wikilink">canonical form</a> has a <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">LexicalEntry</a> as domain and a <a href="#Form" title="wikilink">Form</a> as range. It is a subproperty of the property <a href="#lexicalForm" title="wikilink">lexicalForm</a>. The canonical form has to be unique, so that the property canonical form is declared to be functional:</p>

<p>It is recommended to use the <code class="cm">rdfs:label</code> property to indicate the canonical form in addition to the property <a href="#canonicalForm" title="wikilink">canonicalForm</a> to ensure compatibility with RDFS-based systems that expect an RDFS label. The lexical entries for the noun <em>&quot;cat&quot;</em>, the verb <em>&quot;marry&quot;</em> and the adjective <em>&quot;high&quot;</em> would look as follows (in Turtle syntax):</p>

<p>The following example shows how we can model the fact that a word is ambiguous with respect to the meanings it denotes, for example the word 'troll' can refer both to a mythical creature and to someone who makes inflammatory posts on the internet. These two meanings can be easily captured as shown in the following example:</p>

<p>Note that the target of a denotation does not need to be an individual in the ontology but may also refer to a class, property or datatype property defined by the ontology. The model is agnostic with respect to the ontology language used to express the ontological meaning referred to. The assumption is merely that the entity in the range represents some predicate that has a denotational semantics in some formal logical system.</p>
<p>Properties in the model for linking to ontologies have an inverse property named as &quot;is <em>x</em>-ed by&quot;, where <em>x</em> is the original property name to enable the lexicon to be defined in an ontology focused manner. In the case of denotes this property is isDenotedBy.</p>
<p>In some cases the meaning of a lexical entry is not explicit in the given ontology. Yet, to represent the meaning of a lexical entry we might want to create a new class at the interface between lexicon and ontology by reusing atomic ontological entities defined in the ontology in question. For example, we might want to express the meaning of an adjective by creating an anonymous restriction class at the level of the lexicon-ontology interface. This is illustrated below for the adjective &quot;female&quot; expressing the membership of an anonymous class ∃gender.{female}:</p>

<p>A <strong>lexical sense</strong> represents the lexical meaning of a lexical entry when interpreted as referring to the corresponding ontology element. A lexical sense thus represents a reification of a pair of a uniquely determined lexical entry and a uniquely determined ontology entity it refers to. A link between a lexical entry and an ontology entity via a Lexical Sense object implies that the lexical entry can be used to refer to the ontology entity in question.</p>

<p>Via the lexical sense object we can attach additional properties to a pair of lexical entry and ontological predicate that it denotes to describe under which conditions (context, register, domain, etc.) it is valid to regard the lexical entry as having the ontological entity as meaning. For example, we may wish to express the usages of the word &quot;consumption&quot; in terms of the topic and diachronic usage of the word. As shown in the following example, we can use the Dublin Core property <em>subject</em> to indicate the topic of the Sense. The example also shows how to use the property <em>dating</em> defined in the LexInfo ontology to specify that the fourth sense of consumption is outdated.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The interpretation of a word (lexical entry) with respect to a meaning defined in a given ontology is often modulated by usage conditions or pragmatic implications in particular due to <em>register</em>, <em>connotations</em> or <em>meaning nuances</em> of a word. For example, consider as an example the French words 'rivière' and 'fleuve', which refer to rivers flowing into a sea and flowing into other rivers, respectively. As corresponding ontological classes to capture the specific meanings of these French words might not be available in the ontology, these meaning nuances can be specified using the property <a href="#usage" title="wikilink">usage</a>, which allows information to be captured related to usage conditions and pragmatic implications under which the lexical entry can be used to refer to the ontological meaning in question. These usage conditions are not introduced <em>instead of</em> a formally defined sense but complement the corresponding sense by additional information describing the usage of the lexical entry.</p>
<p>How exactly constraints on the usage of senses are defined is not specified by <i>lemon</i>. Yet, we give an example below that shows how to model the lexical meaning of 'rivière' and 'fleuve' when used to refer to the DBpedia class <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/River">River</a>:</p>

However, sometimes we would like to express the fact that a certain lexical entry <a href="#evokes" title="wikilink">evokes</a> a certain mental concept rather than that it refers to a class with a formal interpretation in some model. Thus, in lemon we introduce the class <a href="#LexicalConcept" title="wikilink">Lexical Concept</a> that represents <em>a mental abstraction, concept or unit of thought that can be lexicalized by a given collection of senses</em>. A <a href="#LexicalConcept" title="wikilink">lexical concept</a> is thus a subclass of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept">skos:Concept</a>.</p>

<p>The lexical entry is said to <a href="#evokes" title="wikilink">evoke</a> a particular lexical concept, similar to how a lexical entry <a href="#denotes" title="wikilink">denotes</a> an ontology reference.</p>

<p>The <strong>evokes</strong> property relates a lexical entry to one of the lexical concepts it evokes, i.e. the mental concept that speakers of a language might associate when hearing the lexical entry.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>Domain:</strong> Lexical Entry</p>

<p>The evoked concept is different from the reference in the ontology, as the reference primarily gives an interpretation of a word in terms of the identifiers that would be generated by the semantic parsing of the sentence. For example if we were to understand the sentence <em>John F. Kennedy died in 1963</em>. we may understand the verb &quot;die (in)&quot; as generating the URI <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathDate">deathDate</a> within a SPARQL query. However, we might also want to record the actual lexical sense of the word with respect to a mental lexicon, in which <em>die</em> evokes the event of dying, as modelled in the following example:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/ontolex/example13.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/ontolex/example13.png'></a></p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>We can link a lexical concept to a lexical sense that lexicalizes the concept via the property <a href="#lexicalizedSense" title="wikilink">lexicalized sense</a>:</p>

<p>The combined usage of the properties denotes, sense, evokes, concept and lexicalized sense is demonstrated in the example below for the case of a lexical resource such as Princeton WordNet.

<p>In addition to organizing a lexicon by lexical entries, we may alternatively create a lexicon of concepts, by means of the the <a href="#ConceptSet" title="wikilink">concept set</a> class, defined as follows:</p>
<div id="ConceptSet" class='entity'>
<h3>Concept Set (Class)</h3>

<h2 id="syntactic-frames">Syntactic Frames</h2>
<p>Most words in a language do not stand by their own, but have a certain syntactic behavior in the sense that they appear in certain syntactic structures and require a number of syntactic arguments to be complete. Examples of this are i) transitive verbs (e.g. to own), which require a syntactic subject and a syntactic object, ii) relational nouns (e.g. capital (of), mother (of), son (of), brother (of), etc.), which require a prepositional object, or iii) adjectives, which require a noun to modify, etc. The syntactic behavior of a lexical entry is defined in lemon by a syntactic frame:</p>
<div id="SyntacticFrame" class='entity'>
<h3>Syntactic Frame (Class)</h3>

<div class='comment'>
<p>A <strong>syntactic frame</strong> represents the syntactic behavior of an open class word in terms of the (syntactic) arguments it requires. It essentially describes the so called subcategorization structure of the word in question, in particular the syntactic arguments it requires.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
</div>
</div>
<p>In order to relate a lexical entry to one of its various syntactic behaviors as captured by a syntactic frame, the <code class="cm">synsem</code> module defines the <a href="#synBehavior" title="wikilink">syntactic behavior</a> property. Each lexical entry should have its own syntactic frame instance, generic behavior such as 'transitive' should be captured by classes.</p>

<h2 id="ontology-mappings">Ontology Mappings</h2>
<p>At the lexicon-ontology interface, syntactic frames need to be mapped or bound to ontological structures that represent their meaning. In the same way that a lexical sense binds a lexical entry to an ontology entity, the <a href="#OntoMap">OntoMap</a> maps a syntactic frame onto an ontology entity.</p>

</div>
<p>In order to link an <a href="#OntoMap" title="wikilink">ontology map</a> to a corresponding sense, the model foresees the property <a href="#ontoMapping" title="wikilink">ontoMapping</a>, which is defined as functional and inverse functional, that is in exact 1:1 relationship with a lexical sense. As such, it is recommended that in the case that a lexicon requires both the <a href="#OntoMap" title="wikilink">ontology map</a> and the <a href="#LexicalSense" title="wikilink">lexical sense</a>, then these two entities are defined using the same URI as there is no technical reason to distinguish them and they have very similar functions.</p>

<p>The <code class="cm">synsem</code> module introduces the property <a href="#ontoCorrespondence" title="wikilink">ontoCorrespondence</a> to establish a mapping between an argument of a predicate defined in the ontology and the syntactic argument that realizes this predicate argument in a given syntactic frame:</p>

<p>Without limitation, we assume that an ontology consists of symbols representing individuals, unary predicates and binary predicates, as indicated by the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<th class="leftalign"><p>Predicate</p></th>

</table>
<p>Predicates with an arity of more than two can be represented by complex senses (see below). This is due to the fact that this module is aligned to RDF and OWL, which distinguish between: individuals/resources (constants), classes (unary predicates) and properties (predicates of arity &quot;2&quot;).</p>
<p>In the following, we introduce three sub-properties of the <a href="#ontoCorrespondence" title="wikilink">ontoCorrespondence</a> property. The first property <a href="#isA">is a</a> is used to refer to the single argument of a unary predicate in the ontology:</p>
<div id="isA" class='entity'>
<h3>Is A (Object Property)</h3>

<p>Following the terminology used in RDF/OWL we call the first argument of a property its <strong>subject</strong> and the second argument the <strong>object</strong>. The <code class="cm">synsem</code> module defines two properties <strong>subjOfProp</strong> and <strong>objOfProp</strong> that can be used to refer to the 1st (subject) and 2nd (object) argument of a property, that is a predicate of arity &quot;2&quot;.</p>
<div id="subjOfProp" class='entity'>

</div>
<p>Finally, we can specify the reference <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/owner">owner</a> that expresses the meaning of &quot;to own&quot; with respect to the DBpedia ontology, specifying the mapping between arguments of the property <strong>owner</strong> and the arguments that realize these arguments syntactically.</p>

<p>In many cases, the meaning of a syntactic frame can not be expressed by exactly one binary predicate as in the examples given above. Take for instance the case of a transitive verb <em>(to) launch</em>, which subcategorizes a subject expressing the company that launched a product, a direct object expressing the launched product, and a prepositional object introduced by the preposition <em>in</em> indicating the year of the launch of the product in question. The important thing here is that there are three syntactic arguments (subject, object and prepositional object, represented as <code class="cm">arg1</code>, <code class="cm">arg2</code> and <code class="cm">arg3</code> below, respectively) that realize the arguments of a complex predicate that consist of the sub-predicates <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/product">dbpedia:product</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/launchDate">dbpedia:launchDate</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, the <code class="cm">synsem</code> module introduces the property <a href="#submap" title="wikilink">submap</a> that relates a (complex) ontological map involving various ontological predicates to a set of less complex ontological maps that bind the arguments of one of the involved predicates to a syntactic argument that realizes it.</p>

<p>It is possible to specify that a certain argument is not compulsory by the <a href="#optional" title="wikilink">optional</a> property. It is generally only advised to use this property with complex senses. Indicating that an argument is optional means that it does not have to be realized syntactically in which case from a semantic point of view the corresponding argument of the ontological predicate is existentially quantifier over. In the above example we have indicated that <code class="cm">arg3</code> is optional, allowing to assign the correct semantics to an expression such as <em>X launched Y</em> by existentially quantifying over the year.</p>

<h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>Conditions describe precise conditions that must be met by a context in which a lexical entry can be used to refer to a certain ontological predicate (reference). These contextual conditions are attached to the lexical sense that mediates the relation between a lexical entry and the ontological predicate it can be used to express.</p>
<div id="condition" class='entity'>

<p>The <strong>condition</strong> property defines an evaluable constraint that derives from using a certain lexical entry to express a given ontological predicate.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Two special types of conditions are defined in the synsem module, which formulate constraints on the type of arguments that can be used at the first or second position of a property when a certain lexical entry is used to express that property. Take for instance the distinction between the English verbs <em>(to) ride</em> and <em>(to) drive</em>. Both express the means of transportation, but have different implications. Ride implies that the means of transportation is a bike. Instead of introducing different ontological predicates and different senses, the modulation can be captured by specifying restrictions on the values that can fill the 1st or 2nd argument of the corresponding ontological predicate. This is illustrated by the example below:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/synsem/example9.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/synsem/example9.png'></a></p>

<p>It is important to note that the <a href="#propertyDomain" title="wikilink">propertyDomain</a> or <a href="#propertyRange" title="wikilink">propertyRange</a> properties do not modify in any way the ontological status or commitment of the corresponding property (here: methodOfTransportation). Instead, they make explicit certain implications on the type of arguments involved that derive from the use of a certain lexical entry to express the property in question.</p>

<h2 id="subterms">Subterms</h2>
<p>Decomposition is the process of indicating which elements constitute a multiword or compound lexical entry. The simplest way to do this is by means of the <a href="#subterm" title="wikilink">subterm</a> property, which indicates that a <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entry</a> is a part of another entry. This property allows us to specify which lexical entries a certain compound lexical entry is composed of.</p>

<p>The property <strong>subterm</strong> relates a compound lexical entry to one of the lexical entries it is composed of.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: LexicalEntry</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: LexicalEntry</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The subterm property is used to indicate which terms have been derived from another term by means of adding or removing words, for example</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/decomp/example1.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/decomp/example1.png'></a></p>

<pre><code class="cm">:AfricanSwineFever a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
  decomp:subterm :SwineFever .</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The subterm property may also be used to indicate the decomposition of compound words. The following example shows how to indicate that the German compound <em>Lungenentzündung</em> ('pneumonia' literally 'lung inflammation') is decomposed into the lexical entries <em>Lunge</em> and <em>Entzündung</em>:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/decomp/example2.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/decomp/example2.png'></a></p>

  decomp:subterm :Lunge_lex;

<p>It is important to mention that the subterm property is a relation between lexical entries and does neither indicate the specific inflected word of a lexical entry that appears in the compound nor the position at which it appears.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>The subterm property allows us to indicate which lexical entries a compound is composed of, but it does not indicate the internal structure of the compound. This can be achieved by introducing so called <a href="#component" title="wikilink">components</a>. Such components represent a fixed list of each of the elements that compose a lexical entry. In the most common case of a multiword expression, the components of the lexical entry are the individual tokens that compose that entry.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to add inflectional properties to the component to uniquely determine the actual form of the lexical entry. This inflectional information can be attached to the component as shown in the following example for the Spanish term 'comunidad autónoma' (federal state), whose second word is the singular feminine form <em>autónoma</em> instead of the canonical form <em>autónomo</em>.</p>

<p>The syntactic categories of the phrases are indicated using the property olia:hasTag from the <a href="http://nachhalt.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/owl/">OLiA vocabulary</a> using the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn TreeBank tagset</a>.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use the synsem module in conjunction with the decomp module to indicate the phrase structure tree of a frame. This is done by making the frame the target of the <em>correspondsTo</em> property and including components in the tree that correspond to individual arguments. As such it is possible to represent modelling of lexicalized grammars within the lexicon.</p>

<p>By lexical relations we understand those relations at the surface forms, mainly motivated by grammatical requirements, style (Wortklang), and linguistic economy (helping to avoid excessive denominative repetition and improving textual coherence). Examples of lexical relations are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derivational relation (e.g., adjective → adverb variation: quick vs. quickly)</li>
<li>Morphosyntactic relation (e.g. ecological tourism vs. eco-tourism)</li>
<li>Abbreviation relation (including acronyms, e.g., peer to peer and p2p; WYSWYG, FAO, UNO)</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific type of lexical or sense relation can be specified via the object property <a href="#category" title="wikilink">category</a>, which is defined as follows:</p>

<div class='comment'>
<p>A <strong>terminological relation</strong> is a <strong>sense relation</strong> that relates two lexical senses of terms that are semantically related in the sense that they can be exchanged in most contexts, but their surface forms are not directly related. The variants vary along dimensions that are not captured by the given ontology and are intentionally (pragmatically) caused.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>SubclassOf:</strong> SenseRelation</p>

<p>Examples of categories of terminological relations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diatopic (dialectal or geographical variants) (e.g., gasoline vs. petrol)</li>
<li>Diaphasic (register) (e.g., headache vs. cephalalgia; swine flu vs. pig flu vs. H1N1 vs. Mexican pandemic flu)</li>
<li>Diachronic (or chronological variants) (e.g., tuberculosis vs. phthisis)</li>
<li>Diastratic (discursive or stylistic variants) (e.g., man vs. bloke)</li>
<li>Dimensional variants: the terms point to the same concept but highlight a different property or dimension of the concept (e.g., <em>bio-sanitary waste</em> vs. <em>hospital waste</em>; <em>Novel Coronavirus</em> vs. <em>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</em>; <em>obsolete technology</em> vs. <em>dangerous technology</em>; <em>madre de alquiler</em> (rental mother) vs. <em>vientre de alquiler</em> (womb mother), in Spanish).</li>

<h2 id="translation">Translation</h2>
<p>Translation relates two lexical entries from different languages the meaning of which is 'equivalent'. This 'equivalence` can be expressed at three different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontological Equivalence (Shared reference):</strong> The simplest case is to have two entries in different languages that denote the same ontology entity. In this case they are clearly translations as they have the same interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> In these cases, the lexical entries might not denote exactly the same concept, but their lexical meanings (senses) be equivalent in that they can be exchanged for each other in most contexts. Translation in this case is a subclass of <a href="#SenseRelation" title="wikilink">sense relation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translatable as</strong>: In this case, we underspecify the exact involved meanings of the two lexical entries that are said to be translations of each other, essentially specifying that, in some contexts, one lexical entry in a source language can be replaced by an entry in the target language, depending on the senses of these lexical entries in the given context.</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h2 id="translation-as-shared-reference">Translation as shared reference</h2>
<p>In order to express that the lexical senses of two lexical entries are ontologically equivalent, we do not need other machinery than the one introduced already in the ontolex section above:</p>

</figure>
<p>The LInguistic MEtadata (<em>lime</em>) module allows for describing metadata at the level of the lexicon-ontology interface. This module is intended to complement existing metadata schemas such as <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms">Dublin Core</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">the PROV ontology</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/">VoID</a>, as <em>lime</em> provides a profile to describe metadata as related to the lexicon-ontology interface.</p>
<p>Following the conceptual model of the lexicon-ontology interface, <em>lime</em> distinguishes three main metadata entities:</p>
<ol>
<li>the reference dataset (describing the semantics of the domain, e.g., the ontology),</li>
<li>the lexicon (being a collection of lexical entries),</li>
<li>the concept set (an optional set of lexical concepts, bearing a conceptual backbone to a lexicon)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: the reference dataset here is not limited to OWL vocabularies, but includes any RDF dataset which contains references to objects of a domain of discourse.</em></p>
<p>As a metadata vocabulary, <em>lime</em> focuses on summarizing quantitative and qualitative information about these entities and the relations among them.</p>
<p>Metadata is attached in particular to three types of sets that <em>lime</em> distinguishes:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <strong>set of lexicalizations</strong>, containing the bindings between logical predicates in the ontology and lexical entries in the lexicon</li>
<li>the <strong>set of conceptualizations</strong>, containing the bindings between lexical concepts in the concept set and entries in the lexicon</li>
<li>the <strong>set of lexical links</strong>, linking lexical concepts from a concept set to references in an ontology</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, we provide detailed descriptions for the <em>lime</em> vocabulary to describe metadata for the lexicon as a whole as well as for the three types of sets described above. Metadata about ontologies (and domain datasets as well) and lexical concept sets can be provided by means of the already mentioned existing metadata vocabularies.</p>

<h2 id="lexicon-and-lexicon-metadata">Lexicon and Lexicon Metadata</h2>
<p>The main metadata-bearing entity in lemon is a lexicon object that represents a collection of lexical entries for a particular language.

<p>A lexicon is expected to consist of at least one <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entry</a> and is defined as a subclass of void:Dataset:</p>

<p>The language property can be stated on either a lexicon or a lexical entry (note that all entries in the same lexicon should be in the same language and that the language of the lexicon and entry should be consistent with the language tags used on all forms) and its value should be a literal representing the language.</p>

</ul>
<p>The property <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entries</a> indicates the number of lexical entries contained in a lexicon. The property is also used for lexicalization and conceptualization sets, indicating in this case the number of lexical entries involved in these sets.</p>

<p>In the following example, we describe a lexicalization set expressing how elements of an ontology can be verbalized in Japanese by means of entries from a supplied lexicon. The metadata clearly tells which ontology and lexicon are involved in the lexicalization set, that is <a href="http://www.example.com/ontology" class="uri">http://www.example.com/ontology</a> and <a href="http://www.example.com/lexicon" class="uri">http://www.example.com/lexicon</a>, respectively, as well as the relevant natural language. The knowledge of these facts about a lexicalization set allows us to assess its usefulness for a given task as well to discover relevant lexicalization sets, when we are constrained by the choice of an ontology, lexicon or natural language.</p>
<p>The ontology is modelled as an instance of the class <a href="http://purl.org/vocommons/voaf#Vocabulary">voaf:Vocabulary</a> that is a kind of <a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void#Dataset">void:Dataset</a> representing vocabularies (both RDFS Schemas and OWL Ontologies). We benefit from the more specific distinctions made by VOAF, by breaking down the total number of entities in the ontology (held by the property <a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void#entities">void:entities</a>) into separate counts for the classes and properties (held by <a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void#entities">voaf:classNumber</a> and <a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void#entities">voaf:propertyNumber</a>, respectively).</p>
<p>Similarly, terms from the <em>lime</em> vocabulary are used to represent statistics about the linguistic content of the lexicon and the lexicalization set. Overall, the ontology defines 100 entities and the lexicon 80 lexical entries; however, only 20 entities from the target ontology have been associated with a total of 50 lexical entries. In this sense, only 20 references from the ontology have been actually lexicalized by linking them to a lexical entry.</p>
<p>When counting the entities in the ontology or, in general, in the reference dataset, we recommend to ignore the resources describing the ontology itself (that is an instance of the class <em>owl:Ontology</em>) as well as other metadata entities.</p>

<li>In SKOS(-XL), a lexicalization is expressed via the <code class="cm">skos(-xl):{pref,alt,hidden}Label</code> properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to specifying the number of entities in the ontology lexicalized, it is also possible to give the total number of <em>lexicalizations</em>, that is the total connections between lexical entries and references. This number should in most cases be the same as the total number of lexical senses defined in the lexicon. The value may be given by the absolute number of lexicalizations:</p>

<p>The <strong>lexicalizations</strong> property indicates the total number of lexicalizations in a lexicalization set, that is the number of unique pairs of lexical entry and denoted ontology element.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: LexicalizationSet</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: xsd:integer</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In addition or alternatively to the absolute number of lexicalizations, the model also supports the indication of the average number of lexicalizations per ontology element:</p>
<div id="avgNumOfLexicalizations" class='entity'>
<h3>Average Number of Lexicalizations (Datatype Property)</h3>
<div>

<p>The <strong>average number of lexicalizations</strong> property indicates the average number of lexicalizations per ontology element.</p>
</div>
<div class='description'>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: LexicalizationSet</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: xsd:decimal</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The average number of lexicalizations is calculated as specified by the following formula:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The following example describes an ontology consisting of 30 ontology elements. The corresponding lexicalization set contains 20 lexicalizations involving 15 lexical entries (so some entries have multiple meanings in the ontology). On average, for each element in the ontology there are thus 20/30 = 0.66 lexicalizations.</p>

<p>Finally, the percentage property may be used to express the percentage of entities in an ontology which are lexicalized, formally:</p>

<h2 id="partitions">Partitions</h2>
<p>In many cases, we want to provide descriptive metadata about a subset of a lexicalization set, that is for the subset representing all the lexicalizations for a certain type of ontology entity (class, property, etc.). To logically partition a lexicalization set, the lime module introduces the property <a href="#partition" title="wikilink">partition</a>:</p>
<div id="partition" class='entity'>
<h3>Partition (Object Property)</h3>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: rdfs:Class</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Functional</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, we may limit our metadata about lexicalizations to a particular class, e.g. restricting the metadata to the logical partition of lexicalizations that denote an element in the extension of the corresponding class:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/lime/example5.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/lime/example5.png'></a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In addition, it is also possible to give RDF(S) or OWL types as the target of the <em>resource type</em> property. This allows us to state the number of classes that are lexicalized by at least one lexical entry:</p>

<p>The following example shows how to describe the metadata of a version of <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet 3.0</a> transformed into RDF. The example illustrates how to describe the main components of the resource (a lexicon, a concept set and a conceptualization relating them). The transformation to RDF is based on a straightforward mapping between the WordNet meta-model and the ontolex model:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>synsets</em> -&gt; <a href="#LexicalConcept" title="wikilink">lexical concepts</a></li>
<li><em>words</em> -&gt; <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entries</a></li>
<li><em>senses</em> -&gt; conceptualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>By having this mapping in mind, it should be clear how some of the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/wnstats.7WN.html">statistics about WordNet 3.0</a> would be specified by means of the vocabulary introduced by the <em>lime</em> module:</p>

<h2 id="formal-definition-of-properties">Formal definition of properties</h2>
<p>The lime module essentially provides vocabulary to describe the relation between three sets:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>L</em>: the set of lexical entries</li>
<li><em>O</em>: the set of ontology elements</li>
<li><em>C</em>: the set of concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>The model considers binary relations over these sets as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>R<sub>lex</sub> ⊆ <em>O</em> × <em>L</em>: the set of <strong>lexicalizations</strong>, that is the set of pairs (<em>o</em>,<em>l</em>), with <em>o</em> ∈ <em>O</em>, <em>l</em> ∈ <em>L</em>.</li>
<li>R<sub>con</sub> ⊆ <em>L</em> × <em>C</em>: the set of <strong>conceptualizations</strong>, that is the set of pairs (<em>l</em>,<em>c</em>), with <em>l</em> ∈ <em>L</em>, <em>c</em> ∈ <em>C</em></li>
<li>R<sub>links</sub> ⊆ <em>O</em> × <em>C</em>: the set of <strong>links</strong> between ontology references and concepts, that is the set of pairs (<em>o</em>,<em>c</em>), with <em>o</em> ∈ <em>O</em>, <em>c</em> ∈ <em>C</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For each R<sub>i</sub>, it holds that the relation is a subset of the Cartesian product of the involved sets, i.e. R<sub>i</sub> ⊆ <em>A</em> × <em>B</em></p>
<p>For each of these relations R<sub>i</sub> ⊆ <em>A</em> × <em>B</em>, we define the following counts:</p>
<ul>
<li>''cardinality(R<sub>i</sub>) '': the total number of pairs in the relation R<sub>i</sub></li>
<li><em>count(π<sub>A</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>))</em>: the <em>a</em>'s that occur in at least one pair in R = |{<em>a</em> ∈ <em>A</em> | ∃ <em>b</em> ∈ <em>B</em> . (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) ∈ R}|</li>
<li><em>count(π<sub>B</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>))</em>: the <em>b</em>'s that occur in at least one pair in R = |{<em>b</em> ∈ <em>B</em> | ∃ <em>a</em> ∈ <em>A</em> . (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) ∈ R}|</li>
</ul>
<p>and ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>coverage<sub>A</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em>: ratio between the elements in A that participate in at least one (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) pair, and the total number of elements in A, that is <em>coverage<sub>A</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em>  = |{<em>a</em> ∈ A | ∃ <em>b</em> ∈ B . (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) ∈ R}| / |A|</li>
<li><em>average<sub>A</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em>: average number of <em>b</em>’s in B related with each <em>a</em> in A, that is  <em>average<sub>A</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em> = |R| / |A|</li>
<li><em>average<sub>B</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em>: average number of <em>a</em>’s in A related with each <em>b</em> in B, that is <em>average<sub>B</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>)</em> =  |R| / |B|</li>
</ul>
<p>The lime model does not introduce all the properties to express all of the above counts for all three relations, but has selected to model the following relations:</p>

<h2 id="publication-scenarios">Publication Scenarios</h2>
<p>In this section, we describe different publication scenarios for lemon models. The lexicon ontology model essentially describes three types of entities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>lexicons</strong>: represented by a <a href="#Lexicon" title="wikilink">lime:Lexicon</a></li>
<li><strong>lexicalizations</strong>: relating lexical entries to vocabulary elements; represented by a <a href="#LexicalizationSet" title="wikilink">lime:LexicalizationSet</a></li>
<li><strong>reference dataset or ontology vocabulary</strong>: represented by a <a href="http://rdfs.org/ns/void#Dataset">VoID Dataset</a> or some other subclass such as <a href="http://purl.org/vocommons/voaf#Vocabulary">VOAF Vocabulary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Irrespective of their logical dependencies, all of the entities above can be published as physically independent data sources. At the other end of the set of options, the entities can be published together as one data source.</p>
<p>We highlight four common publication scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Independent resources:</strong> A reference dataset, a lexicon and a lexicalization set are published as independent data sources. This scenario is very common in case of independently developed resources. A reference dataset and a general-purpose (i.e. not tailored towards that dataset) lexicon exist and are published separately (possibly by different publishers). A third party then decides to link these datasets by a <a href="#LexicalizationSet" title="wikilink">lexicalization set</a> and publishes it as a third entity and advertises it through proper lime metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Linking to 3rd party lexicon:</strong> A general-purpose lexicon is published as an independent resource. Then, in developing a reference dataset/ontology, its authors decide to publish it together with a lexicalization set based on the lexical entries from the existing lexicon.</li>
<li><strong>Linking to 3rd party ontology:</strong> A lexicon tailored to an existing reference dataset is published together with a lexicalization set. This is the opposite scenario to scenario 2 above. In this case the reference dataset or ontology vocabulary is the pre-existing resource developed by some 3rd party, and a lexicon is created ad hoc for it, with the associated lexicalizations.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated:</strong> Reference dataset, dataset-specific lexicon and lexicalization set are combined into a single data source: this scenario corresponds to closed environments where a single party is in control of the ontology, the lexicon and the lexicalizations and publishes the three as one dataset. In this scenario, the reference dataset is created and lexicalized with lexical elements created specifically for it. This scenario is the typical setting of ontology vocabularies/datasets naturally lexicalized by means of <code class="cm">rdfs:label</code>, <code class="cm">skos</code> or <code class="cm">skosxl</code> labeling properties.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, there is <em>Concept Set</em> for a collection of lexical concepts and <code class="cm">ConceptualizationSet</code> for the triples expressing how lexical concepts relate to lexical entries from a given lexicon. Similar considerations to the ones above apply to these datasets.</p>
<p>Identifying a Concept Set as an independent dataset allows reusing the same lexical concepts across different conceptualization sets. For example, this allows us to reuse the same lexical concepts from an existing wordnet to conceptualize a lexicon in a different natural language than the one for which the resource was initially conceived. Otherwise, it is possible to define different concept sets, one for each conceptualization set, and then to relate them via a VoID <code class="cm">Linkset</code>.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="linguistic-description">Linguistic Description</h2>
<p>An important goal of a lexicon is to record linguistic properties of the lexical entries defined in the lexicon such as its part-of-speech, gender, aspect, inflectional pattern, etc. The lemon model does not prescribe any vocabulary for doing so, but leaves it at the discretion of the user of the model to select an appropriate vocabulary that is in line with a given theoretical linguistic framework or grammar. We show below how third party category systems can be reused to describe the properties of lexical entires in a lemon lexicon. We will use the [<a href="http://lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo" class="uri">http://lexinfo.net/ontology/2.0/lexinfo</a># lexinfo] ontology in our examples as such as third party ontology describing relevant linguistic categories and properties.</p>
<section>
<h2 id="morphosyntactic-description">Morphosyntactic Description</h2>
<p>A lexicon typically indicates the part-of-speech of a given lexical entry. We can specify the part of speech of a word as follows using the lexinfo vocabulary:</p>

<p>When defining categories, it is crucial to link these categories to other models to establish coherence. The <strong>partOfSpeech</strong> property is defined as follows in lexinfo:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/description/example2.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/description/example2.png'></a></p>
<div>
<pre><code class="cm">lexinfo:partOfSpeech

  rdfs:range lexinfo:PartOfSpeech ;

</div>
</div>
<p>The concrete part of speech &quot;noun&quot; is defined as follows and linked to the ISOcat category DC-1333.</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/description/example2b.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/description/example2b.png'></a></p>
<div>
<pre><code class="cm">lexinfo:noun

</div>
</div>
<p>The following morpho-syntactic properties are defined in the lexinfo ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animacy</strong>: indicating whether a word denotes something animate (human or animal)</li>
<li><strong>Aspect</strong>: indicating the grammatical aspect (e.g. perfect or imperfect for verbs)</li>
<li><strong>Case</strong>: indicating the grammatical case (e.g. nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Cliticness</strong>: indicating whether the word acts as a clitic</li>
<li><strong>Definiteness</strong>: indicating whether the word refers to a particular element in a set</li>
<li><strong>Degree</strong>: indicating whether an adjective is comparative or superlative</li>
<li><strong>Finiteness</strong>: indicating whether the form is finite</li>
<li><strong>Gender</strong>: indicating the grammatical gender of a word (e.g. female, masculine, neuter etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Modification Type</strong>: indicating whether a modifier precedes or follows a word</li>
<li><strong>Mood</strong>: indicating the modality (imperative, conditional, etc.) of a verb</li>
<li><strong>Negative</strong>: indicating the negative form of verbs (e.g. in Japanese)</li>
<li><strong>Number</strong>: indicating the grammatical number of a word (e.g. singular, plural, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Part of speech</strong>: indicating the syntactic category of the word in question (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Person</strong>: indicating whether a noun or pronoun refers to the speaker (first person) or listener (second person) or other entity (third person) and agreeing forms of verbs</li>
<li><strong>Tense</strong>: indicating whether a word makes a temporal reference to the past, present or future</li>
<li><strong>Voice</strong>: indicating the type of sentence (active vs. passive voice)</li>
</ul>
<p>When using these properties, care should be taken to distinguish between linguistic properties of the entry itself and properties of any of the forms. By default, it should be assumed that a property of a lexical entry also holds for all its forms. For example, in many languages gender is an entry property for nouns, but a form property for adjectives, for example:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>For convenience, lexinfo also introduces specific classes for each part of speech so that the part of speech of a word can be specified by a rdf:type statement. For example, the part of speech Noun is defined as follows:</p>
<p><em>Noun</em> ≡ ∃ partOfSpeech.NounPOS</p>
<p>It is recommended to use both the rdf:type statement as well as the <strong>lexinfo:partOfSpeech</strong> to maximize interoperability in spite of the small redundancy:</p>

<h2 id="pragmatic-paradigmatic-description">Paradigmatic Description</h2>
<p>Pragmatic aspects related to the usage of a lexical entry as well as the paradigmatic relationships between lexical entries can also be described using the lemon model by resorting to some external vocabulary. As for the case of the description of the morphosyntactic properties of lexical entries and their forms, lemon does not prescribe any vocabulary but encourages the use of external vocabularies to describe aspects related to the temporal use of a lexical entry, e.g. to indicate whether the use of the lexical entry is modern or anachronic or to specify lexico-semantic relationships between lexical senses. Examples of such paradigmatic or lexico-semantic relationships are: synonymy, antonymy, holonymy, hypernymy, meronymy, etc.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2>
<p>When describing syntactic frames it is important to specify the grammatical role or function played by different syntactic arguments. We might want to specify, for instance, which argument plays the grammatical role of subject and which argument plays the role of a direct object, etc. LexInfo distinguishes the following types of arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>: indicating the syntactic subject of a sentence. The subject typically expresses the agent of the action denoted by the verb, but this need not to be so in all cases. In a passive construction, the subject actually expresses the patient or beneficiary of the action denoted by the verb.</li>
<li><strong>Object:</strong> distinguishing between direct, indirect, prepositional (a non-optional object marked with a preposition) and genitive objects</li>
<li><strong>Adjunct</strong>: adjuncts are optional arguments. Lexinfo distinguishes between <em>prepositional</em>, <em>possessive</em>, <em>comparative</em> and <em>superlative</em> arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Copulative</strong>: a copulative argument indicates one argument involved in a so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)">copula construction</a> involving a copulative verb. Lexinfo distinguishes the copulative subject and the copula predicate.</li>
<li><strong>Clausal</strong>: certain verbs also subcategorize a whole clause or sentence as an argument (e.g. the verb (to) claim). In this case lexinfo talks about a clausal argument and distinguishes between declarative, gerundive, infinitive, interrogative (infinitive), possessive infinitive, prepositional gerund/interrogative, sentential or subjunctive clausal arguments.</li>
<li><strong>Attributive</strong>: The word modified by an an adjective in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective">attributive construction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each argument is associated with a specific property indicating the grammatical role to the actual object representing the syntactic argument.</p>

  lexinfo:copulativeArg :father_frame_arg1 ;
  lexinfo:possessiveAdjunct :father_frame_arg2 .

:father_frame_arg1 a lexinfo:CopulativeArg .

:father_frame_arg2 a lexinfo:PossessiveAdjunct .</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="frames">Frames</h2>
<p>Syntactic or subcategorization frames describe which syntactic arguments a certain lexical entry (verb, noun etc.) requires to be complete. A verb that requires a subject and a direct object is called a <em>transitive verb</em>. The corresponding frame that generalizes across particular verbs is called <em>transitive</em> frame or <em>transitive construction</em> (in construction grammar theories).</p>
<p>In lexinfo, frames can be axiomatized by describing which type of arguments they subcategorize. A transitive frame would be axiomatized as follows in lexinfo:</p>
<p><code class="cm">   TransitiveFrame ≡ VerbFrame ⊓ (=1 subject ⊓ =1 directObject)</code></p>
</section>

<h2 id="confidence">Other properties</h2>

<p>In addition, it is possible to define other properties in an external resource,
that may be difficult to translate across resources. An example of such a property
is translation confidence as shown below:</p>

<h2 id="lexical-nets">Lexical Nets</h2>
<p>Lexical nets, so called wordnets in particular, are an important type of lexical resource used very often in natural language processing applications. Lexical nets organize the senses of words into groups of equivalent meaning, so called <em>synsets</em>. Further, synsets are related to each other using lexico-semantic relationships so that the the resource can be regarded as a &quot;net&quot;. We discuss below how lexical nets can be represented using the lemon vocabulary using Princeton wordnet as an example.</p>
<section>
<h2 id="lexical-nets-in-lemon">Lexical nets in OntoLex-lemon</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, lexical nets indicate the different lexical senses that a word has and groups these senses into sets of equivalent senses (so called synsets). Below we state how the main entities of a lexical net (words, lemmas, senses and synsets) can be represented in lemon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synset</strong>: Lexical Concept</li>
<li><strong>Word</strong>: Lexical Entry</li>
<li><strong>(Word) Sense</strong>: Lexical Sense</li>
<li><strong>Lemma</strong>: Canonical Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Lexico-semantic relations should be represented between lexical concepts. The WordNet-RDF ontology defines some of these lexico-semantic relations:</p>

<h2 id="relation-to-other-models">Relation to Other Models</h2>
<p>In this section, we informally clarify the relation to other models, in particular SKOS, the Lexical Markup Model (LMF), and the Open Annotation standard.</p>
<section>
<h2 id="skos-xl">SKOS(-XL)</h2>
<p>SKOS is a vocabulary used to represent so called <em>knowledge organization systems</em> (KOS), comprising taxonomies, classification schemes, thesauri etc. SKOS thus addresses an orthogonal use case to lemon. lemon was designed to provide detailed information about the linguistic grounding of an ontological vocabulary, specifying in particular by which lexical entries a class or property can be verbalized. SKOS has only a very rudimentary way of doing this, that is by means of SKOS labels and the properties (prefLabel, altLabel and hiddenLabel). This is by no means a criticism of SKOS, but merely to make clear that SKOS and lemon have been designed with a different purpose and use case in mind.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, SKOS and lemon can be used in conjunction to provide more detailed information about the &quot;labels&quot;. We recommend to use the property <a href="#evokes" title="wikilink">evokes</a> and its inverse isEvokedBy to relate a skos:Concept to a <a href="#LexicalEntry" title="wikilink">lexical entry</a>. This is shown in the following example:</p>
<p>The use case we address is one where a thesaurus or other taxonomic resource or classification system in SKOS needs to be enriched with more detailed linguistic information.</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/other/example-skos1.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/other/example-skos1.png'></a></p>
<div>
<pre><code class="cm">:financial_assets a skos:Concept;
                ontolex:lexicalizedSense :financial_assets_lex.

:financial_assets_lex a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
                 ontolex:evokes :financial_assets;
                 ontolex:canonicalForm :financial_assets_form. 

:financial_assets_form ontolex:writtenRep &quot;financial assets&quot;.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The above represents the recommended way of linking a SKOS concept to a lexical entry in the lexicon ontology model.</p>
<p>To show how to make statements about preferred lexicalizations akin to the properties <code class="cm">prefLabel</code>, <code class="cm">altLabel</code> and <code class="cm">hiddenLabel</code> as used in SKOS, the following example shows how to attach such preference information via the lexical senses:</p>
<div class='beispiel'>
<p><a href='Examples/other/example-skos2.png' class='tn'><img alt='no desc' src='Examples/other/example-skos2.png'></a></p>
<div>
<pre><code class="cm">:tuberculosis a skos:Concept;
     ontolex:isEvokedBy :tuberculosis_lex;
     ontolex:isEvokedBy :consumption_lex.

:tuberculosis_lex a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
      ontolex:sense :tuberculosis_sense;
      ontolex:evokes :tuberculosis.
   
:tuberculosis_sense a ontolex:LexicalSense;
      ontolex:isLexicalizedSenseOf :tuberculosis; 
      ontolex:usage [ rdf:value &quot;preferred&quot; ].

:consumption_lex a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
       ontolex:sense :consumption_sense;
       ontolex:evokes :tuberculosis.

:consumption_sense a ontolex:LexicalSense;
        ontolex:isLexicalizedSenseOf :tuberculosis;
        ontolex:usage [ rdf:value &quot;outdated&quot; ]. </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In case you are using reified labels as in SKOS-XL, it is possible to have forms or lexical entries in the range of the <code class="cm">skosxl:prefLabel</code>, <code class="cm">skosxl:altLabel</code> and <code class="cm">skosxl:hiddelLabel</code> properties. However, we note that from this it would follow that lexical entries and forms would be inferred to be <code class="cm">skosxl:Label</code>s, which does not correspond to the understanding of forms and lexical entries of this community as linguistic objects rather than mere `labels'.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="lmf">LMF</h2>
<p>The Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) (ISO-24613:2008) is a standard for representing machine readable lexicons. The model is not suited, however, to publish lexica on the web as linked data as it only knows a serialization in XML rather than in RDF. Further, LMF does not address the interface between lexica and ontologies as lemon does.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the lemon model draws heavy inspiration from the LMF model. lemon has imported many classes/entities from LMF and adopted its core ontology. On the other hand, lemon has added vocabulary to describe the syntax-semantics interface with respect to an ontology and remove a number of classes that create syntactic overhead. A complete description of the relationship between LMF and the original lemon model is provided <a href="http://lemon-model.net/lemon-cookbook/node46.html">here</a>. The main differences are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li>lemon defines the meaning of a term by reference to an ontology element defined by the OWL model.</li>
<li>lemon provides a more compact description than LMF to describe the syntax-semantics interface</li>
<li>lemon relies on external category system and linguistic ontologies to describe linguistic properties of lexical entries instead of proposing an own category system</li>
<li> lemon does not include a module for describing inflectional morphology patterns (called intentional morphology in LMF). Further, it does not allow to define global constraints on the lexicon. This can be done using OWL axioms, but not in lemon itself.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="openannotation">OpenAnnotation</h2>
<p>In many uses cases the need arises to annotate a text corpus with links to entities defined in a lexicon, e.g. lexical entries, forms, lexical senses, lexical concepts etc. lemon does not support this annotation per se, as there are other models that are dedicated exactly to this. This is the case for the <a href="http://openannotation.org/">Open Annotation</a> standard. In both models an element of the lexicon may be the target of an annotation. This target may be a form, lexical entry, lexical sense or lexical concept and it is important to give the class to make clear what the target of the annotation is.</p>
<p>We will now give an example of annotating a word &quot;cat&quot; occurring at character 7 in a file at the URL <a href="http://www.example.com/doc.txt">2</a>, where the <em>lemon</em> element is given as the body of an annotation. For example</p>
